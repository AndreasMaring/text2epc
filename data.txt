The manufacturing department creates a production order by converting a Planned Order using the Production Planning and Control system. Alternatively, the production order is created manually. In this case basic data is entered manually. Thereafter the system tries to determine the routing automatically. If the routing already exists, then operation data is transferred from the routing to the production order. If the routing does not exist, then operation data is captured manually by the manufacturing department. Thereafter the system automatically determines the BOM. If the BOM exists, the components are transferred to the production order. Otherwise, if BOM does not exists, the components are entered manually. Alternatively, the components may be transferred from the planned order, if the BOM has not been determined. Once the components are entered, the manufacturing department reviews the production order data and afterwards the system schedules the production order. Finally, the production order is saved.
