When a business trip is necessary, the sales department makes an application for a business trip, which the sales department hands in at the secretary’s oce for approval. The application is normally approved by the manager after a while and comes back again to the sales department’s post box. Then the sales department asks around whether the company car is available. If it is available, the sales department books it, otherwise the sales department orders a rental car. At the date of the business trip, it is realized and at the end of it the accounting takes place. Is a business trip not approved, the sales department checks whether it has to discard it, and, for example, integrate it into another business trip some time. Otherwise it goes over the part of reasoning in particular and hand it in at the secretary’s oce once more. If an employee places a request for a business trip, the secretary checks at first whether the business trip is in accordance with the requirements for business trips of myLibro Plc. Then the secretary hands in the request with a respective note at the manager’s oce. Only if the business trip is accepted, the secretary makes a note of the employee and period of the business trip into the presence file. The secretary puts the request, approved or re-jected, into the pigeon hole of the employee.
